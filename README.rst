ramsmod
========
A library for analysing reliability data that was developed
to support the RAMS modelling course at Ã–rebro University.

E.g.
.. code-block:: python

    from ramsmod.datasets import load_right_censored
    from ramsmod.fitting import kaplan_meier_fit

    data = load_right_censored()
    km_table = kaplan_meier_fit(data['t'], data['d'])
    print(km_table)

Features
--------

- Visualising right-censored and interval-censored failure data.
- Fitting reliability curve to right-censored and interval-censored failure data using the Kaplan-Meier and Turnbull methods.
- Comparison of reliability between two groups of failure data using log-rank (right-censored data) and Mantel (interval-censored data) tests.

Installation
------------

Install ramsmod by running:

    pip install ramsmod
